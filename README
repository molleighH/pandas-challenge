# PyCitySchools Analysis

Welcome to the PyCitySchools analysis project! This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis of a city's school district, focusing on standardized test scores and school performance metrics. As the newly appointed Chief Data Scientist for the district, I've conducted a detailed analysis to help the school board and mayor make informed decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

## Project Overview

In this project, I utilized Python's powerful data manipulation library, Pandas, within a Jupyter Notebook environment to analyze and visualize key metrics across the district. The analysis focuses on aggregating data from various schools and showcasing trends that reveal the overall performance of the district and individual schools.
